# Replication of Sieg and Yoon (2017)

Hello world! Welcome to our replication repository of Sieg and Yoon (2017).

Here, we replicate the results of their article "Estimating Dynamic Games of Electoral Competition to Evaluate Term Limits in US Gobernatorial Elections", published in the *American Economic Review*, available here: https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20150566.<br/>
We use Julia instead of Matlab and take advantage of its features in terms of numerical computations.

All our coding files are available in detail here, but documentation and results are available on our [website](https://vho97.github.io/Replication_of_Sieg_Yoon_2017.jl/).

This replication study was part of our evaluation for the course [Numerical Methods](https://floswald.github.io/NumericalMethods/) at SciencesPo Paris in Spring 2021.<br/>
